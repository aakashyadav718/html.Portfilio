    <h3>Civil Engineering and software Engineering</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My academic interests extend into Software engineering and civil
        engineering. I've explored specific topics such as vector
        calculations, the theory of plate load tests (IS 1888-1982),
        strain-stress relationships in complex systems, and the structural
        design of roads, data structur and algorithms, machine learing, alzebra , probability, 
        Engineering Grphpics and verious topics.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am also interested in the settling characteristics of particles in
        different settings, which ties into your broader interest in civil
        engineering calculations.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Trading:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have a budding interest in trading and have engaged with trading
        strategies, particularly through content by Vivek Singhal. Despite a fear
        of losing funds, I am determined to become a full-time trader,
        showcasing a willingness to take calculated risks.

          efficiency and simplicity.
        </li>
        <li>
          I tend to lean towards solutions that are
          both effective and efficient, as seen in my avoidance of unnecessary
          complexity like 3D DP arrays, Graphs, BS, BST, String, Bit Manitpulation, Recursion,
          Sliding Windows problem, stack and queue , linklist, greedy algorithms and sorting techinque.
